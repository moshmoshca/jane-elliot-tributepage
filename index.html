            <p>Jane Elliot is an American <strong>diversity educator</strong>. As a schoolteacher, she became known for her <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/karinabland/2017/11/17/blue-eyes-brown-eyes-jane-elliotts-exercise-race-50-years-later/860287001/"><strong>"Blue eyes/Brown eyes"</strong></a> exercise, which she first conducted with her third-grade class on April 5, 1968, the day after the assassination of <a href="#">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> Publication in the local newspaper of compositions the children had written about the experience led to much broader media interest</p> <br>
            <p>The classroom exercise was filmed in <b>1970</b>, becoming the documentary The Eye of the Storm. PBS series Frontline featured a reunion of the 1970 class, as well as Elliott's work with adults, in its 1985 episode "A Class Divided". Invitations to speak and to conduct her exercise eventually led Elliott to give up school teaching and to become a full-time public speaker against discrimination. She has directed the exercise and lectured on its effects in many places throughout the world. She also has conducted the exercise with college students, as seen in the 2001 documentary <a href="#">The Angry Eye.</a></p>

            <h2>The beginnings</h2>
            <!-- Add an image here -->
            <p>Born in 1933 to Lloyd and Margaret (Benson) Jennison on her family's farm in or near Riceville, Iowa. Her father, who delivered her, was Irish-American. She was the fourth of several children.</p>
            <p>In 1952, after graduating from high school, Elliott attended the Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), where she attained an emergency elementary teaching certificate in five quarters. In 1953, she began her teaching career in a one-room school in Randall.</p>

            <h2>Personal life</h2>
            <p>Elliott was married to Darald Elliott (1934 - 2013) from 1955 until his death, and has four children. They maintained residences in Osage, Iowa and Sun City, California. On May 24, 2019, Jane Elliott was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters by CSU Bakersfield.</p>

            <h2>Motivation to teach about racism's effects</h2>
            <!-- Add an image here -->
            <p>On the evening of April 4, 1968, Elliott turned on her television and learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She says that she vividly remembers a scene in which a white reporter pointed his microphone toward a local black leader and asked things like "When our leader [John F. Kennedy] was killed several years ago, his widow held us together. Who's going to control your people?"</p>
            <p>Elliott then decided to combine a lesson that she had planned about Native Americans with a lesson that she had planned about Martin Luther King Jr. for February's Hero of the Month project. At the moment she was watching the news of King's death, Elliott says she was ironing a teepee for use in a lesson unit about Native Americans. To tie the two lessons together, she used the Sioux prayer "Oh great spirit, keep me from ever judging a man until I have walked in his moccasins. [sic]" She wanted to give her small-town, all-white students the experience of walking in a "colored child's moccasins for a day".</p>
